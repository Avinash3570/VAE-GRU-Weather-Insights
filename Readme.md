**🌦️ Time Series Forecasting & Anomaly Detection with VAE & GRU**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project implements **Time Series Forecasting** and **Anomaly Detection** on weather data using:

- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** for detecting anomalies in weather patterns.
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** for predicting future weather conditions.

The dataset used is the **Hourly Weather Surface - Brazil** dataset, containing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other atmospheric conditions.

**Source**: Kaggle - Hourly Weather Surface, Brazil

**🔹 Data Preprocessing**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions, time series plots.
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Normalizing/standardizing data.
- Creating sequences for time series forecasting.
- Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
